# Mycroft Skills Kit

The Mycroft Skills Kit - `msk` - is a Python-based utility that has been created to make it easier for **Skill** Authors to create, test and submit **Skills** to the [Skills Marketplace](https://market.mycroft.ai). We hope this utility helps to shorten the development cycle, and remove some of the tedious parts of **Skill** creation.

`msk` currently supports the following features:

* Create a new **Skill**
* Create an `Intent` test for a **Skill**
* Upload a **Skill**
* Upgrade an existing **Skill**

## Installing msk

_NOTE: `msk` has only been tested on Linux systems_

`msk` comes pre installed on the [Mark 1](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/mark-1), [Picroft](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/picroft) and the `git` installation of Mycroft-core. The utility is self-contained and can be installed separately using `pip` by typing the following line into the terminal on your Linux system:

```bash
pip3 install msk
```

You should then see output like the below:

```bash

```

To check that the installation was successful `msk --help` can be run and should list the arguments and options for the utility.

## Usage

The normal commands for `msk` are:

```bash
msk create
msk create-test $HOME/.local/share/mycroft/skills/myskill
msk upload $HOME/.local/share/mycroft/skills/myskill
msk upgrade $HOME/.local/share/mycroft/skills/myskill
```

If using the built-in installation of `msk` with a Mycroft device or Mycroft git installation, use `mycroft-msk` in place of `msk`:

```bash
mycroft-msk create
mycroft-msk create-test $HOME/.local/share/mycroft/skills/myskill
mycroft-msk upload $HOME/.local/share/mycroft/skills/myskill
mycroft-msk upgrade $HOME/.local/share/mycroft/skills/myskill
```

## Create

Next, we use the `msk create` function. You will be prompted to enter the required information to help set up your **Skill**.

```bash
$ msk create
Enter a short unique skill name (ie. "siren alarm" or "pizza orderer"):
Feed the Corgi

Class name: FeedTheCorgiSkill
Repo name: feed-the-corgi-skill

Looks good? (Y/n) Y
Enter a one line description for your skill (ie. Orders fresh pizzas from the store):
- Reminds you to feed your poor starving Corgi
Enter a long description:
> Every 24 hours, Mycroft will send you a reminder to feed your Corgi, and tell you what your Corgi was fed the previous day, so you can provide a different delicious meal for your precious Corgi.
>
Enter some example phrases to trigger your skill:
- Have I fed the Corgi today
- What did I feed the Corgi yesterday
- Remind me to feed the Corgi at 5pm
-
Enter author: YourGitHubUserName

Categories define where the skill will display in the Marketplace. It must be one of the following:
Daily, Configuration, Entertainment, Information, IoT, Music & Audio, Media, Productivity, Transport.
Enter the primary category for your skill:
- Daily
Enter additional categories (optional):
- Productivity
-
Enter tags to make it easier to search for your skill (optional):
- Dogs
-

Would you like to create a GitHub repo for it? (Y/n) Y

Now, if you look in `$HOME/.local/share/mycroft/skills/` you will see that all the files required for the **Skill** have now been created, including the `.voc` files.

```bash

4 -rw-rw-r-- 1 kathyreid kathyreid   16 Jun  7 05:20 corgi.the.feed.intent
```

## Create test

`msk` also provides a function for creating `Intent` tests, as part of our [Automated Testing for Skills](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/skills/automatic-testing/).

Please see this ASCII Cinema video to see the process for using `msk create-test`:

[![msk-create-test](https://images2.imgbox.com/9c/c8/gLRS7xuL_o.gif)](https://asciinema.org/a/Ayzaj6QJbKGBfs2eIQWr11idH?speed=1.5)

As before if the mycroft-core github installation is used make sure to use `mycroft-msk` or activate the mycroft-core Python _virtual environment_. From the mycroft-core folder

`$ source .venv/bin/activate`

Next, we use the `msk create-test` function. You _must_ pass the **Skill** directory location to the command, or it will fail.

```bash
$ msk create-test $HOME/.local/share/mycroft/skills/feed-the-corgi-skill/

Which intent would you like to test?
1. corgi.the.feed.intent

> 1

=== Intent Examples ===
Corgi the feed

Enter an example query: have I fed the corgi today?

Choose expected dialog (leave empty to skip).
1. corgi.the.feed

> 1
Generated test file: $HOME/.local/share/mycroft/skills/feed-the-corgi-skill/test/intent/corgi.the.feed.intent.0.intent.json
```

If we have a look inside the `corgi.the.feed.intent.0.intent.json` file we can see that the test has been created for us.

```javascript
$ cat $HOME/.local/share/mycroft/skills/feed-the-corgi-skill/test/intent/corgi.the.feed.intent.0.intent.json
{
    "intent_type": "corgi.the.feed",
    "expected_dialog": "corgi.the.feed",
    "utterance": "have I fed the corgi today?"
}
```

## Upload Skill

`msk` also provides a function for uploading a **Skill** to the [Mycroft Skills Repo](https://github.com/mycroftai/mycroft-skills), as part of our \[Skill Submission Process\] \([https://mycroft.ai/documentation/skills/skill-submission/](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/skills/skill-submission/)\).

Please see this ASCII Cinema video to see the process for using `msk upload`:

[![msk-upload](https://images2.imgbox.com/35/5d/BCVxUxuh_o.gif)](https://asciinema.org/a/Bp1sORVnmVz9wYjZXfempTPoO?speed=1.5)

If using the msk delivered with the mycroft-core github installation be sure to use `mycroft-msk` or activate the mycroft-core Python _virtual environment_. From the mycroft-core folder

`$ source .venv/bin/activate`

You will now see that your `bash` prompt is prefixed with `(venv)`.

Next, we use the `msk upload` command with the path to the **Skill**:

```bash
$ msk upload $HOME/.local/share/mycroft/skills/feed-the-corgi-skill/

```

## Upgrade Skill

`msk` also provides a function for upgrading a **Skill** once it has been merged into the [Mycroft Skills Repo](https://github.com/mycroftai/mycroft-skills), as part of our \[Skill Submission Process\] \([https://mycroft.ai/documentation/skills/skill-submission/](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/skills/skill-submission/)\).

### Before you upgrade

Before you can use `msk upgrade`, you must ensure:

* That your **Skill** has already been merged with the `mycroft-skills` repo.
* That you have made changes to your **Skill** and that these changes have been committed to the **Skill's** `git` repository.

Once your changes are committed, you can then use `msk upgrade` by passing the location of the Skill folder. Generally we find it's easiest to be inside the Skill's folder in `$HOME/.local/share/mycroft/skills/SKILL-NAME` and then use the current directory symbol, period `.`
