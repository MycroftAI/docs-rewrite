# Get Mycroft

You can purchase a dedicated Mycroft device, or download Mycroft and run it on your own hardware, be it a Raspberry Pi, computer, or an Android phone.

## Download

You can download Mycroft and run it on your own hardware, be it a Raspberry Pi, computer, or an Android phone.

### Picroft

Picroft is specifically packaged to run on a Raspberry Pi 3 or 3B+. It is built on top of the official Raspbian Stretch Lite and is available as a disk image ready to be burned to a Micro SD card. For Mycroft to hear you and respond to you, just connect a speaker and a USB microphone to your Pi.

### Mycroft for Linux

If you are a technical user, run Mycroft on your favorite Linux distro, including Ubuntu/Debian, Arch, Fedora. Install it using either a shell script or a standalone installer.

### Windows and Mac

We’re not quite ready to release Mycroft natively for Windows and macOS. If you are keen to help and have technical experience on these platforms, please let us know!

However you can run Mycroft on MacOS and Windows inside a virtual machine using VirtualBox.

Run Mycroft in a Docker container. This can be installed using our [pre-built image from Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mycroftai/docker-mycroft/), or by building the image manually.

### Mark II

The Mark II is our next-generation smart speaker designed for you and your family, whatever your level of technical expertise. At the same time, it is open hardware and software for developers, makers and hackers.

### Mark 1

Mark 1 is a no-fuss way to get started. It has been designed specifically to work with Mycroft’s capabilities as a standalone device. Great for those who aren’t super technical, but it can be easily extended, altered, modified, and hacked.

_The Mark 1 is currently sold out._
